		    <h2>What is Citizen-Based Monitoring (CBM)?</h2>

		    <p>
		      Citizens and public service users are active holders of fundamental rights and not merely passive users of public services. Citizen-based monitoring allows civil society to  gather and analyse information from the service usersâ€™ points of view to provide a strong body of evidence to take back to government and, where necessary, into the public domain, in order to better the delivery of services where needed and to acknowledge good service where it is provided.
